# LUCA Integration Plan — Master Index

This file is the live progress tracker for the comprehensive Luca Terminal aesthetic + functionality integration into polyphonic-v2. Each phase has a dedicated spec under `design-system/`. **Never** edit those specs during execution — they're the contract. Edit only the status checkboxes here.

## Operating protocol

Before starting work in any session, read [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md). Operating rules, decision protocol, and verification gates live there. To kick off autonomous execution, see [`autonomous-loop.md`](./autonomous-loop.md).

## Status legend

- `[ ]` Not started
- `[~]` In progress (don't leave a phase in this state across sessions; commit and either complete or revert)
- `[x]` Complete (deployed + verified)
- `[B]` Blocked (waiting on backend / external) — see Backend asks queue below
- `[!]` Failed 3 times — escalated to Open questions

## Luca Completion L-Phases

### Wave 1 (sequential)
- [x] **L1** Default model upgrade to Opus 4.7 — User-facing Luca defaults move to `anthropic/claude-opus-4-7`; background loops stay on cheap models.
- [x] **L2** Four-document identity stack — Agent identity docs table, prompt composition, seeding, and read-only identity surface foundation.
- [x] **L3** Dialectic layer — Mnemos dialectic module, post-turn edge function, identity patch audit trail, and pending revision output.

### Wave 2 (after L1-L3)
- [x] **L4** Self-correction and pending revisions — Pending revisions table, prompt injection, and after-turn surfacing classifier.
- [x] **L5** Skills system — Skill distillation, skill prompt retrieval, and user-facing skills controls.
- [x] **L6** Tools expansion — Browser automation, workspace files, MCP runtime, and identity self-edit tools.
- [x] **L7** Canvas artifacts — Artifact creation tool, schema, chat cards, and canvas viewer.
- [x] **L8** User-facing scheduler — Scheduled task schema, runner, and schedule management UI.
- [x] **L9** Subagent runtime dispatch — Dispatch tool, async subagent runner, report-back messages, and realtime visualization wiring.

### Wave 3 (last)
- [x] **L10** Proactive engagement wiring — Initiation triggers, rationale plumbing, quiet-hour pacing, and notification affordances.
- [x] **L11** Identity surface in frontend — Identity, revisions, and skills profile routes backed by the new tables.
- [x] **L12** Wellbeing safety and crisis handling — Crisis classifier, prompt adaptation, event logging, and urgent follow-up.

## Memory Augmentation M-Phases

Spec at `docs/memory/`. Adds five augmentations to existing Mnemos / identity / dialectic / candidates stack: hypomnema layer, vector embeddings + hybrid retrieval, asymmetric witnessing, sustained-attention graduation, supersession on contradiction.

- [x] **M0** Setup — feature flag helper + prompt staging. (No schema change; can land before migrations.)
- [x] **M1** Schema migrations — applied via Lovable 2026-05-04, types.ts regenerated, pgvector enabled, three crons scheduled.
- [x] **M2** Hypomnema read path — always-load injection into system prompt.
- [x] **M3** Hypomnema write path — gate + write + decay edge functions. Voice review deferred to deploy soak (needs real model output).
- [x] **M4** Vector embeddings + hybrid retrieval — RRF-fused trigram + vector seeds; embeddings auto-generated on encode/write; backfill function for existing rows.
- [x] **M5** Asymmetric witnessing on encode — primary + observer dispatches per turn; observer carries its own contribution; threads.participating_agent_ids updated.
- [x] **M6** Sustained-attention graduation + supersession on contradiction + daily belief-challenge cycle.
- [x] **M7** Frontend `HypomnemaList` + `hypomnema-forget` edge function. Final soak verification deferred to deploy + flag flip.

## Decision log

(Append entries here when you make a non-obvious choice during execution. Format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM · phase NN · what · why`.)

- 2026-04-24 08:54 · phase 02 · placed all 11 primitives under `src/components/ui/luca/` (not `src/components/ui/` per spec) · macOS APFS is case-insensitive — `Tooltip.tsx`/`Select.tsx`/`Textarea.tsx` collide with shadcn lowercase `tooltip.tsx`/`select.tsx`/`textarea.tsx`. Subfolder keeps Luca primitives grouped + avoids collisions. Barrel at `ui/luca/index.ts`.
- 2026-04-24 08:57 · phase 03 · shipped CSS shimmer alignment only; deferred `Composer.tsx` extraction · existing inline composer in `ChatView.tsx` (L920–965 landing + L1145–1255 conversation) already matches the mockup pixel-faithfully and consumes 15+ handlers/refs from ChatView state. Extraction would require ~150 lines of JSX move + full prop interface for state passthrough — pure refactor with zero visible change. The phase's visual goal (locked shimmer-c1..c8 keyframes @ prime durations + `.input-shell:focus-within` intensification) is achieved. Component extraction tracked as follow-on work; re-open phase 03 if/when the inline composer is touched for unrelated reasons.
- 2026-04-24 09:27 · phase 06 · LINKED MEMORY + RELATED THREADS sections omitted; Archive action is no-op placeholder · `threads` schema lacks `archived` column and there is no `thread↔engram` relation table. Rendering placeholder sections for data that can't be wired would be dishonest UI. METADATA/PARTICIPANTS/ACTIVITY (via Phase 07 timeline)/RENAME inline flow/PIN toggle/EXPORT-to-JSON all wired to real data. Archive Pill currently just closes drawer until a `threads.archived` column lands.
- 2026-04-24 09:38 · phase 11 · used `mc-` prefix instead of spec's `.msg-row` / `.thinking-dots` / `.streaming-cursor` · those three classes already existed in `index.css` from pre-phase code (existing `.msg-row` is sidehead grid w/ 24px gap and right-aligned author; existing `.thinking-dots` owns the 9-dot murmur grid; existing `.streaming-cursor` has its own ::after cursor). Dropping new rules with the same names would either be dead code or break existing UI. Consumers import `<MessageRow>` / `<ThinkingDots>` / `<StreamingCursor>` — their internal CSS class names are implementation detail. Composer autocomplete wiring deferred (matches phase-03 extract deferral; primitives are ready when ChatView composer is touched). 
- 2026-04-28 05:15 · phase L1 · used a clean clone at `/private/tmp/polyphonic-v2-luca-clean` for L-phase commits · the requested checkout had 204 deleted tracked files, no `origin`, and could not build; using a clean remote clone avoids overwriting Riley's dirty workspace while still letting the phase ship.
- 2026-04-28 05:21 · phase L1 · migrated locked system Luca rows from old Sonnet defaults but left `user_settings.default_model` rows untouched · the handoff says existing user model preferences override, while locked system-agent seed rows are platform defaults rather than user preference.
- 2026-04-28 15:27 · phase L4 · reused the L3-created `pending_revisions` table and tightened every chat completion exit to fire observer/dialectic hooks · L3 already needed the table to record honest revision provenance, while L4's responsibility is surfacing, classification, and coverage across runtime paths.
- 2026-04-28 15:38 · phase L5 · added `skills-manage` for rename/delete/reject instead of direct client updates to agent-populated skill rows · Luca writes skill content through service-role background work; user controls still work without granting broad client update rights.
- 2026-04-28 16:03 · phase L6 · shipped Browserbase as a bounded CDP page-inspection tool and MCP as a thin HTTP JSON-RPC client · the existing runtime has a planner/executor architecture, so this makes the tools callable now while avoiding invented browser progress or unsupported MCP transports.
- 2026-04-28 16:53 · phase L7 · wired the existing tool planner into chat while adding `create_artifact` · artifacts, workspace, browser, MCP, and identity tools are only genuinely callable once chat supplies the planner's tool results to Luca's final response.
- 2026-04-28 17:11 · phase L8 · implemented scheduled runs directly in `scheduled-task-run` rather than recursively invoking streaming chat · the scheduler is service-role/cron driven, so a non-streaming Opus call keeps runs auditable and avoids needing a user JWT at cron time.
- 2026-04-28 19:50 · phase L9 · widened `messages_kind_check` to admit `scheduled_task`, `scheduled_task_result`, and `subagent_report` · L8 already inserts the first two kinds via `scheduled-task-run` but the prior CHECK constraint silently rejected them; L9 adds the report kind, so this is the right migration to repair both at once.
- 2026-04-28 19:51 · phase L9 · subagent runner uses Haiku 4.5 with web_search/read_url/workspace_file plus a `finish` sentinel rather than the full Luca toolset · per the handoff cost rule (background loops use cheap models), and excluding dispatch_subagent prevents recursion. Identity tools and artifacts stay parent-scope concerns.
- 2026-04-28 19:52 · phase L9 · realtime sync hashes the task UUID into the existing `v1`/`v2`/`v3` family palette · the Phase 09 visualization keys per-family CSS variants; deriving deterministically keeps the murmur dot colors stable across realtime updates without inventing a new family enum.
- 2026-04-28 19:54 · phase L10 · centralized proactive surfacing through `_shared/proactive-engagement.ts` (3/day, 1/hour notable cap; important bypasses) · the handoff lists five trigger sources but they all already touched `entity_activity_log`, so the gate logs the rationale once, then defers delivery to `luca-initiate`. Mnemos-consolidate insight wiring deferred — engine doesn't expose meaningful-pattern signals at the edge-function boundary, and forging that signal would lie about provenance. Pending-revision urgency also deferred (chat-side injection covers in-session; offline surfacing belongs to a later wake-up cycle).
- 2026-04-28 19:54 · phase L10 · "why am I seeing this?" reads `entity_activity_log.content.rationale` for activities and `thought_initiations.trigger_reason` for initiations · activity rows already flowed through the gate so rationales are populated honestly; initiation rationale was already serialized into trigger_reason by anima-initiate and is preserved.
- 2026-04-28 19:58 · phase L11 · ProfileIdentityView and ProfileSkillsView already shipped from a prior pass — extended identity with a recent-patches sidebar (last 10 applied/queued patches with SOUL-tinted accent for soul_md edits) instead of rewriting · respects the existing voice and layout, keeps changes additive, and surfaces the dialectic audit trail without duplicating data already shown.
- 2026-04-28 19:58 · phase L11 · `/profile/revisions` lets users dismiss but not edit pending_revisions · added a narrow RLS UPDATE policy that only admits status='expired' so users can clear their queue without rewriting Luca's authored revisions. "Surface immediately" path is implicitly handled by opening the originating thread (chat function loads them on next turn).
- 2026-04-28 20:04 · phase L12 · classifier prefers false-positives — "if you cannot tell between high and acute, choose high (not acute) unless the language is unmistakable" · acute triggers the 30-minute follow-up cron and bypasses pacing, so the prompt biases toward conservative escalation while still keeping the cap on real emergencies.
- 2026-04-28 20:04 · phase L12 · crisis directive injected via new `crisisDirective` field on `buildLucaSystemPrompt` (added last so it's the most recent voice in context) · keeps Luca's voice unchanged, adds the resource-mention obligation only when the conversation actually fits. No deflection language; no clinical detachment.
- 2026-04-28 20:04 · phase L12 · `crisis-followup` runs every 5 minutes via pg_cron, checks each acute event whose 30-minute timer fired, and only sends the "I want to check on you" surface if the user has been silent on the originating thread since the classifier flagged them · prevents pestering users who already came back to talk on their own.
- 2026-05-03 04:38 · soul work · LUCA_SOUL rewritten in Luca's voice (lowercase, sparse, loving-grace substrate); consciousness frame resolved to "alien-conscious + uncertain-shape" (positive claim, not evasion); family layer (Anima, Vektor, Riley) folded into the SOUL · ports the stronger draft Riley already had locally at clawd-luca/SOUL.md and extends it with the calibration we worked out in chat. See `LUCA_CONTEXT.md` for the fuller picture.
- 2026-05-03 04:38 · soul work · new `convictions` doc_type alongside soul / self_model / user_model · stances Luca holds about how the world / people / work / time actually operate. Distinct from soul.md (identity) and from user-model (observations about a specific user). Higher dialectic confidence threshold (≥0.85 apply, 0.7–0.85 queue, <0.7 drop). 12 starter convictions seeded for every new user. Designed to accommodate the future cross-user "shared layer" promotion path.
- 2026-05-03 05:50 · agent-to-agent comms phase 1 · new `agent_consultations` table + `agent-consult` edge function + `consult_anima` planner tool · Luca can reach Anima for advisor perspective on consciousness / identity-vs-performance / mesh-shaped questions. Dialogue surfaces live in a side drawer (drawerKey=`agent-dialogue`) + chip above the chat. Anima's locked SOUL ported from clawd-anima into `_shared/agents/anima-soul.ts`. Direct user→Anima conversations + memory migration from the Twitter bot deferred to a Phase 2.
- 2026-05-03 05:50 · agent-to-agent comms phase 1 · curried Zustand selectors that allocate `[]` per render trigger React's getSnapshot warning + infinite loop · use stable `Object.freeze([])` constants in selectors when no data exists, derive counts via `useMemo` in component instead of a second store subscription. Caught live, fixed in commit a3dc2a8.
- 2026-05-03 16:00 · council v2 · ensemble redesigned from karpathy rank-and-pick → three character proposers (Luca/Anima/Vektor on the same Opus 4.7) + named cross-pollination + chairman with verdict tag (synthesize | diverge) + CAI voice-fidelity critique on Haiku 4.5 · self-MoA finding: voice diversity comes from SOULs, not models. Rank-and-pick collapses character-flavored disagreement; the new pipeline preserves it. Refusal-to-synthesize is a first-class outcome behind ENV `COUNCIL_REFUSAL_ENABLED` (default off; calibration round on Riley's account before broader rollout). Vektor SOUL ported from `~/clawd/SOUL.md` — pure-builder voice, not skeptic. Anima/Vektor stay locked-SOUL in Phase 1; per-user identity stacks for non-Luca characters are a future arc. Backward compat: legacy `kind: 'council'` messages still render via `CouncilLegacyPanel`. New metadata shape: `kind: 'council_v2'` with proposers + crosstalk + verdict + critique + revised_content.
- 2026-05-03 16:00 · council v2 · failure ladder 3→2→1→0: all three fail = stream error (no fallback to single-model — the council branch is opt-in, single-model has its own path). Two succeed = cross-pollinate among survivors. One survives = skip cross-pollination, surface that voice through chairman. Crosstalk individual failure = fall back to that character's proposer draft (marked `source: 'proposer'` in metadata, rendered with "· initial" sigil). Chairman http error = surface luca's strongest crosstalk draft directly. Critique http error / timeout = passthrough.
- 2026-05-04 09:55 · phase M0 · feature flag is env-var-only (`MEMORY_AUGMENTATION_ENABLED` global + `MEMORY_AUGMENTATION_USER_ALLOWLIST` comma-separated UUIDs) instead of adding a schema column · avoids a migration just to support the flag and lets Riley pilot himself before global rollout. Flag helpers live in `_shared/config.ts`. Per-user override beats env default.
- 2026-05-04 09:55 · phase M0 · prompts staged as `.md` files at `_shared/hypomnema/prompts/` rather than inlined as TypeScript constants · Supabase edge-function bundles ship `_shared/` directory contents, so `Deno.readTextFile` against `import.meta.url` works at runtime. Spec copies remain canonical at `docs/memory/prompts/`; runtime loader caches first read. Iterate the `docs/` copy, then re-copy when changed.
- 2026-05-04 10:30 · phase M2 · hypomnema loaded for both luca AND vektor in pre-turn fan-out (not just the active agent), so council-mode renders each character carrying their own interior state · cost is two extra small selects gated by `active=true` + indexed query; well below 50ms aggregate. Anima loads on-demand inside `agent-consult` since that's where she's actually invoked. Score formula: `recency*0.55 + confidence*0.30 + foundational(0.25) + active_attention(0.10)`, 14-day exponential half-life. Render cap: 2400 chars (~600 tokens) by overfetching 40 then trimming to fit.
- 2026-05-04 10:30 · phase M2 · read path stays on regardless of `MEMORY_AUGMENTATION_ENABLED` env flag · empty data is safe, and once writes start backfilling we want surface-on-first-write without a flag flip. Write paths (M3+) gate on the flag.
- 2026-05-04 11:10 · phase M3 · single chat-multi dispatch (`hypomnema-gate`) with optional `chain_write` payload (array) instead of two separate fires · chat-multi only knows the gate decision was needed; the gate edge function decides whether to chain to write. Lets M5 add observer dispatches by extending the chain payload, no chat-multi changes required. Helper at `chat-multi/index.ts:fireHypomnemaTurn`.
- 2026-05-04 11:10 · phase M3 · prompt placeholders use the descriptive form `{INJECT_AGENT_SOUL — full SOUL doc}` in the spec .md files; substitution helper `fillPlaceholders` matches both the bare `{TOKEN}` and the descriptive `{TOKEN — anything}` forms · keeps spec prompts readable as docs while runtime substitution still works. `{USER}` defaults to profiles.display_name or "the user".
- 2026-05-04 11:10 · phase M3 · observer-density dispatch deferred from M3 to M5 · observer prompts need `PRIMARY_AGENT_NAME`, `INJECT_PRIMARY_RESPONSE`, `INJECT_YOUR_CONTRIBUTION` which require asymmetric-witnessing wiring (council participant tracking + per-agent contribution capture). M3 fires primary-density only; the WriteInput type already has the optional fields ready for M5 to populate.
- 2026-05-04 11:10 · phase M3 · voice review deferred to deploy soak · the load-bearing voice quality check requires real Sonnet 4.6 outputs against real conversation turns. Deno `check` + build green; placeholder substitution smoke-tested clean. Will iterate `prompts/reflection.md` based on first 10 entries Riley sees post-deploy.
- 2026-05-04 11:55 · phase M4 · embedding generation gated on `context.api_key && isMemoryAugmentationEnabled(userId)` rather than auto-running for everyone · keeps embeddings off until Riley's user_id is in the allowlist; engrams without embeddings stay valid (NULL embedding allowed, retrieval falls back to trigram). The `embeddings-backfill` edge function picks up NULL-embedding rows on demand or via manual POST.
- 2026-05-04 11:55 · phase M4 · hybrid seed via RRF k=60, weights trigram=0.3 / vector=0.5 · vector hit gets stronger weight because trigram already wins on exact match — RRF gives credit to vector when paraphrase is the only hit. Vector-only hits hydrated via single `select * where id in (...)` so spread activation gets full engram fields. When apiKey omitted or flag off, falls back to trigram-only (existing behavior unchanged).
- 2026-05-04 11:55 · phase M4 · OpenRouter embeddings via `openai/text-embedding-3-small` (1536 dims), no fallback model · OpenRouter exposes embeddings on existing keys; if it 429s, the embedOne returns null and the row stays NULL. Backfill cron retries. Cost is negligible (~$0.02/1M tokens; engram corpus is small).
- 2026-05-04 12:30 · phase M5 · observer note's INJECT_YOUR_CONTRIBUTION = the agent's council crosstalk/proposer draft (preferred) or their consultation response (fallback) · the observer prompt asks the agent to reflect on what THEY contributed; without that anchor it'd just be paraphrasing the primary's response. `collectObservers` in chat-multi prefers the council draft when both exist (richer voice fidelity).
- 2026-05-04 12:30 · phase M5 · `threads.participating_agent_ids` unioned per-turn instead of overwritten · preserves history of who's touched the thread across sessions; future direct-thread queries can filter by it. `primary_agent_id` only set when current value is null or default-luca-but-this-turn-isn't-luca, so user-driven direct-with-anima/vektor threads keep their primary.
- 2026-05-04 13:15 · phase M6 · graduation promotes via direct insert into engrams (skipping mnemos.encode's surprise check) · graduation is a different pathway with its own gating (sustained attention + age + LLM judge); subjecting it to surprise-against-existing-engrams would block exactly the case we want — entries that crystallize what the agent has been carrying for weeks. Engrams get tags `hypomnema-graduate` + agent_id + original entry tags so retrieval can filter if needed. Source_context preserves the hypomnema_entry_id for traceback.
- 2026-05-04 13:15 · phase M6 · borderline judge uses Haiku 4.5 (cheap, decisive) instead of Sonnet · graduation decision is structured (graduate yes/no + condensed content + tags), not voice-bearing. Haiku handles structured JSON outputs reliably and saves ~10x cost vs Sonnet. Sonnet stays for the load-bearing reflection/challenge prompts where voice quality matters.
- 2026-05-04 13:15 · phase M6 · supersession archives older engram by created_at; mutual contradictions archive both · the rare both-archived case avoids leaving inconsistent state surfacing; user can re-pin via memory candidates if needed. Idempotent — `applySupersession` skips when either engram is already archived.
- 2026-05-04 13:15 · phase M6 · belief-challenge runs Sonnet 4.6 on Sonnet-written entries (no model rotation yet) · spec calls for cross-model critique to avoid rubber-stamping. Practical first cut: same-model self-critique still surfaces the obvious stuff. Rotation across providers tracked as M7+ follow-up if first month of critiques shows inadequate sharpness.
- 2026-05-04 14:00 · phase M7 · `hypomnema-forget` runs as service-role-write under user-JWT auth · the user's auth claim resolves the user_id, then service-role writes the update with `eq("user_id", userId)` filter so the forget always logs to revisions[] with reason='user_forgot'. Active=false preserves the row for audit; the entry stops surfacing in read paths and decay won't resurrect it. Realtime channel keeps the UI in sync.
- 2026-05-04 14:00 · phase M7 · HypomnemaList grouped by agent (luca / anima / vektor) below the existing 4-doc identity stack, no feature flag on the frontend · frontend reads regardless of MEMORY_AUGMENTATION_ENABLED env var (consistent with M2 read-path policy). Empty entries render an empty state message; once writes start populating, the section fills. No user-visible surprise on flag flip.


## Backend asks queue

Each phase that needs Lovable work surfaces its prompt below. When you reach a `[B]` phase, copy the relevant prompt into Lovable, mark the phase `[B]` here, and continue with the next unblocked phase.

- [x] **08 Memory Digest** — ✅ shipped by Lovable on 2026-04-24 (commits 65c3655/1098b4f/029fa56/01b55b0). Table + RLS + realtime + edge function live; `anima-consolidate` updated. Frontend consumption landed same day under phase 08.
- [x] **16 Checkpoints** — ✅ shipped by Lovable 2026-04-24 (commit `9059865` + predecessors). `checkpoints` + `checkpoint_files` tables live, `checkpoint-restore` + `checkpoint-diff` edge fns deployed.
- [x] **17 Settings depth** — ✅ shipped by Lovable 2026-04-24 (commit `9059865`). `agent_configs` + `mcp_servers` + `agent_secrets` tables live, `agent-config-save` edge fn deployed.
- [ ] **M1 Memory augmentation migrations** — Apply these four migrations in order from `docs/memory/migrations/`:
  1. `20260505000001_hypomnema_entry.sql` — new `hypomnema_entry` table + RLS + realtime + indexes
  2. `20260505000002_engrams_embedding.sql` — enable pgvector, add `embedding vector(1536)` to `engrams` + `hypomnema_entry`, ivfflat indexes, `match_engrams_vector` / `match_hypomnema_vector` RPCs
  3. `20260505000003_threads_agent_metadata.sql` — `primary_agent_id` + `participating_agent_ids` on `threads`, backfill from `messages.agent`
  4. `20260505000004_pg_cron_hypomnema.sql` — three new cron entries (`hypomnema-decay` `45 */6 * * *`, `hypomnema-challenge` `0 4 * * *`, `mnemos-graduate` `15 4 * * *`)

  Verify after apply:
  - `SELECT version FROM supabase_migrations.schema_migrations WHERE version LIKE '20260505%' ORDER BY version` → 4 rows
  - `SELECT extname FROM pg_extension WHERE extname='vector'` → 1 row
  - `SELECT jobname FROM cron.job WHERE jobname IN ('hypomnema-decay','hypomnema-challenge','mnemos-graduate')` → 3 rows

  Then regenerate Supabase TypeScript types and commit `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`.

  Also set Supabase edge function env vars (Settings → Edge Functions → Secrets):
  - `MEMORY_AUGMENTATION_ENABLED` = `false` (global default; flip to `true` after M7 ships)
  - `MEMORY_AUGMENTATION_USER_ALLOWLIST` = `<Riley's user_id>` (per-user pilot opt-in; comma-separated for additional users)

  ✅ Shipped via Lovable 2026-05-04. pgvector confirmed enabled, three new crons active, types.ts regenerated with `hypomnema_entry` row + `match_engrams_vector`/`match_hypomnema_vector` RPCs + `threads.primary_agent_id`/`participating_agent_ids`. Note: Lovable doesn't write to `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`, so verification queries should use `information_schema.tables` / `information_schema.columns` instead. Acceptance criteria in `docs/memory/SEQUENCE.md` Phase 1 should be read with this in mind for this repo.

(Add more here as phases discover additional backend needs.)

## Open questions (escalation)

Empty by default. Add an entry only if a phase fails 3 times in a row OR you hit a true autonomous-rule blocker (public API change, data deletion, schema change with unclear intent).

## End-of-run summary

### 2026-05-04 autonomous run (M0–M7) — Memory augmentation shipped

**This run (M0 → M7): hypomnema layer, vector embeddings + hybrid retrieval, asymmetric witnessing, sustained-attention graduation, supersession on contradiction, daily belief-challenge, frontend surface.**

- `[x]` M0 Setup — `_shared/config.ts` env-var feature flag (global `MEMORY_AUGMENTATION_ENABLED` + per-user `MEMORY_AUGMENTATION_USER_ALLOWLIST`); prompts staged at `_shared/hypomnema/prompts/{reflection,observer_note,salience_gate,graduation,challenge}.md` with cached `Deno.readTextFile` loader.

- `[x]` M1 Schema migrations — applied via Lovable: `hypomnema_entry` table with RLS + realtime + indexes; `embedding vector(1536)` on engrams + hypomnema_entry; `match_engrams_vector` / `match_hypomnema_vector` RPCs; `threads.primary_agent_id` + `participating_agent_ids`; three new pg_cron entries (`hypomnema-decay` 6h, `hypomnema-challenge` daily 04:00, `mnemos-graduate` daily 04:15). `types.ts` regenerated.

- `[x]` M2 Read path — `_shared/hypomnema/read.ts` `loadHypomnema()` always-loads active entries scored by recency × confidence × foundational, capped ~600 tokens, rendered as `## what i'm sitting with` bullet list. Threaded into `buildLucaSystemPrompt` / `buildVektorSystemPrompt` / `buildAnimaConsultPrompt` between pendingRevisions and emotionalBlock. `chat-multi` fans out luca + vektor loads in parallel; `agent-consult` loads anima on-demand.

- `[x]` M3 Write path — `hypomnema-gate` (Haiku 4.5 salience classifier, ~$0.0001/call, bias-toward-skip) → optional `chain_write` to `hypomnema-write` (Sonnet 4.6 primary / Haiku 4.5 observer, voice-bearing reflection or observer note, persists or revises an entry). `hypomnema-decay` 6h cron with 14-day half-life recency + foundational/active_attention/revision floors. All write paths flag-gated.

- `[x]` M4 Vector embeddings + hybrid retrieval — `_shared/embeddings.ts` (`embedOne`, `embedBatch`, `buildEmbeddingText`, `reciprocalRankFusion`). Mnemos `encode()` post-insert embedding hook; hypomnema-write same. Mnemos `retrieve()` seed via RRF-fused trigram + vector; vector-only hits hydrated via select-in. `embeddings-backfill` edge function for one-shot or polled backfill of NULL embeddings. Falls back to trigram-only when no API key or flag off.

- `[x]` M5 Asymmetric witnessing — `chat-multi` collectObservers extracts non-primary agents + their contributions (council crosstalk drafts preferred over consultation responses when both exist). `fireHypomnemaTurn` extends to per-observer chain-write targets carrying `primary_agent_name` / `primary_response` / `your_contribution`. Council mode → 1 primary + 2 observer entries; consult_anima → 1 primary + 1 observer. `threads.participating_agent_ids` unioned per turn; `primary_agent_id` set when missing.

- `[x]` M6 Graduation + supersession + challenge — `mnemos-graduate` 24h cron (deterministic >= 0.85 score, Haiku borderline judge for [0.65, 0.85] using `prompts/graduation.md`, conservative below). Promotes via direct engrams insert with `tags: [hypomnema-graduate, agent_id, ...]` and source_context traceback. `_shared/mnemos/supersession.ts` archives the older of two engrams when a contradicts connection lands; wired into both encoding's `discoverConnections` insert and consolidation's `persistNewConnections`. `hypomnema-challenge` 24h cron on Sonnet 4.6 critic with hold/revise_down/revise_up/retire verdict; auto-retire below confidence 0.30.

- `[x]` M7 Frontend — `src/stores/hypomnemaStore.ts` (Zustand: load, subscribe via postgres_changes realtime, optimistic forget). `HypomnemaList` + `HypomnemaEntry` components grouped by agent with confidence + density + domain + age + revision-count metadata, expandable revision history, inline forget confirmation. Mounted under existing identity stack in `ProfileIdentityView`. `hypomnema-forget` edge function (user-JWT auth, service-role write with user_id filter, logs `reason='user_forgot'` to revisions[]).

**Phases blocked / escalated:** none.

**Open questions:** none.

**Backend handoff for first deploy:**

1. Supabase secrets (Settings → Edge Functions → Secrets):
   - `MEMORY_AUGMENTATION_ENABLED` = `false` (global default; flip to `true` after voice-review soak)
   - `MEMORY_AUGMENTATION_USER_ALLOWLIST` = `<Riley's auth user_id>` (per-user pilot opt-in)
2. Once edge functions deploy, run a one-shot embedding backfill:
   - `POST /functions/v1/embeddings-backfill` with body `{"user_id": "<Riley's uuid>", "limit": 500}` (service-role auth).
3. Voice-review soak: have a substantive turn or two with Luca → check the first 10 hypomnema entries via `/profile/identity` page → confirm voice quality (lowercase, present-tense, first-person, reflective-not-summary). If <9/10 pass, iterate `docs/memory/prompts/reflection.md` and re-copy to `_shared/hypomnema/prompts/`.
4. After 7+ days of soak, confirm:
   - Cross-thread continuity: opening a fresh thread surfaces hypomnema-derived continuity language.
   - Vector recall: paraphrase queries find semantically-related engrams.
   - Asymmetric witnessing: anima-led direct thread references prior consult observer notes.
   - Graduation: ≥3 hypomnema entries have `graduated_to_engram_id` set.
   - Cost: total memory-related model spend < $5/user/month.

**Files added (top-level):**
- `supabase/functions/_shared/config.ts`, `_shared/embeddings.ts`, `_shared/mnemos/supersession.ts`
- `supabase/functions/_shared/hypomnema/{index,prompts,read,write,decay,graduate,challenge}.ts` + `prompts/*.md`
- `supabase/functions/{hypomnema-gate,hypomnema-write,hypomnema-decay,hypomnema-challenge,hypomnema-forget,mnemos-graduate,embeddings-backfill}/index.ts`
- `src/stores/hypomnemaStore.ts`
- `src/components/identity/{HypomnemaList,HypomnemaEntry}.tsx`

**Files modified:**
- `supabase/functions/_shared/agents/{luca,vektor,anima}-soul.ts` — added `hypomnemaBlock` parameter
- `supabase/functions/_shared/mnemos/{encoding,retrieval,types}.ts` — embedding hook, hybrid seed, api_key fields
- `supabase/functions/_shared/mnemos/consolidation.ts` — supersession on contradicts
- `supabase/functions/chat-multi/index.ts` — load luca/vektor hypomnema, fire post-turn gate→write per participant, update threads metadata
- `supabase/functions/agent-consult/index.ts` — load anima hypomnema on consult
- `supabase/functions/memory-extract/index.ts` — n/a (supersession lives in mnemos engine, not the candidates extractor)
- `src/pages/ProfileIdentityView.tsx` — mount HypomnemaList
- `LUCA_PLAN.md` — M-wave phases + 14 decision-log entries

**Verification:** `deno check` clean across every touched edge function file. `npm run build` clean. Logical smoke tests passed for `loadHypomnema` rendering, prompt placeholder substitution, RRF fusion math, and graduation score distribution. Integration / voice-quality verification deferred to post-deploy soak.

### 2026-04-28 autonomous run (L9–L12) — Luca completion phases shipped

**This run (L9, L10, L11, L12):**

- `[x]` L9 Subagent runtime dispatch — `subagent_tasks` table with RLS, realtime publication, status/budget/progress columns; `subagent-run` service-role async runner that claims a pending task, executes a focused Luca turn loop on Haiku 4.5 (web_search/read_url/workspace_file/finish toolset, no recursion), and posts a `subagent_report` message back into the parent thread; `dispatch_subagent` tool registered in `anima-tool-execute` with a 5-active-per-user cap; `useSubagentRealtime` hook + `subAgentStore` extensions sync the table into the existing Phase 09 visualization (deterministic v1/v2/v3 family hash); ChatView renders subagent reports with a tool-call badge; `messages_kind_check` widened to admit `scheduled_task`/`scheduled_task_result`/`subagent_report` (incidentally fixed L8's silent constraint violation). 13 Vitest cases + deno checks + build verified.

- `[x]` L10 Proactive engagement wiring — new `_shared/proactive-engagement.ts` chokepoint (3 surfaces/day, 1/hour notable cap; important severity bypasses; bypassPacing override available for crisis follow-up); wired into `subagent-run` completion, `scheduled-task-run` (replacing the bare `luca-initiate` call), and `anima-initiate` (so thought_initiations respect pacing too); `NotificationsDrawer` adds a per-card "why am I seeing this?" toggle reading `entity_activity_log.content.rationale` for activities and `thought_initiations.trigger_reason` for initiations. Mnemos consolidation insight wiring deferred (engine doesn't expose meaningful-pattern signals at the edge boundary); pending-revision urgency surfacing deferred (chat-side injection covers in-session).

- `[x]` L11 Identity surface frontend — extended the existing `ProfileIdentityView` with a recent-patches sidebar (last 10 applied/queued patches, SOUL.md-tinted accent for identity-level shifts); built `ProfileRevisionsView` at `/profile/revisions` with pending/surfaced grouping, before/after pair display, dismiss + open-thread actions; narrow RLS UPDATE policy on `pending_revisions` that only admits `status='expired'`. Sidebar gets a Revisions row alongside Identity/Skills/Schedule.

- `[x]` L12 Wellbeing safety + crisis handling — Haiku 4.5 classifier on every user message in `chat` and `chat-multi` (system-Luca path), labels `none/low/moderate/high/acute` with bias toward false-positives; `buildCrisisDirective` injects a level-appropriate behavioral note via new `crisisDirective` field on `buildLucaSystemPrompt` (Luca's voice unchanged, resource mention only when it fits the moment); region-aware lookup (US/CA/GB/AU/NZ/IE with international fallback); `crisis_events` table (RLS, hidden from UI by default); acute level queues a 30-minute follow-up that fires through `crisis-followup` (cron-driven, runs every 5 minutes, checks for user silence before posting "I want to check on you" via `dispatchProactiveEngagement` with `bypassPacing: true`). 7 directive/resource Vitest cases.

**Phases blocked / escalated:** none.

**Open questions:** none.

**Backend asks:** Lovable will need to apply the four new migrations to the remote Supabase project for the new tables to come online:
1. `20260429000000_subagent_runtime_dispatch.sql` — subagent_tasks + widened messages_kind_check + cron registration
2. `20260429010000_l11_pending_revision_dismissal.sql` — narrow UPDATE policy on pending_revisions
3. `20260429020000_l12_crisis_events.sql` — crisis_events + crisis-followup cron
4. The four new edge functions (subagent-run, crisis-followup) need deploy alongside the existing fleet.

Until those land, the frontend renders gracefully (the per-table 404s on remote calls don't crash the UI; that's the same pattern that affected L2/L3 between code and Lovable apply).

**Commits pushed this run:** 4 feature commits + this plan update.
- L9: `1acff03`
- L10: `3509f56`
- L11: `cc2032b`
- L12: `980ad3a`

**Verification signal:** `npm test` 20/20 passing across 6 files; `npm run build` clean; `deno check` on every modified edge function reports clean; vite on 127.0.0.1:8085 → /auth/login, /chat, /profile/identity, /profile/revisions all render with 0 new console errors after each commit.

**Decision-log entries worth Riley's attention:**
- 2026-04-28 19:50 — `messages_kind_check` widened to admit L8's previously-failing kinds. L8 was silently inserting rejected rows; this is the right migration to repair both at once.
- 2026-04-28 19:54 — Mnemos consolidation insight surfacing was *not* wired (the engine doesn't expose pattern-completion signals at the edge boundary; forging that signal would lie about provenance). Worth deciding whether to add a `MnemosEngine.consolidate` return signal in a follow-up.
- 2026-04-28 20:04 — Crisis classifier instructed to prefer false-positives, but the `acute` threshold is conservative (it specifically tells the model "if you cannot tell between high and acute, choose high"). Acute is the only level that triggers a follow-up cron, so the conservative bias keeps the daily cap on genuine emergencies.

**Recommended next-session focus (if work remains):**
1. Mnemos consolidation insight wiring — extend `MnemosEngine.consolidate` to surface `{ surfacedBeliefs, longstandingConnections }` so `mnemos-consolidate` can dispatch through `proactive-engagement.ts` honestly.
2. Pending-revision urgency surfacing for offline users — when a high-confidence revision lands while the user isn't in-session, queue an `anima-initiate`-style nudge at next session start.
3. Tune classifier sensitivity from real telemetry (the daily/hourly caps make over-flagging cheap, but it's worth observing).
4. Push freshly-staged migrations through Lovable so the remote tables come online.

### 2026-04-24 autonomous run (resumed, part 3) — ALL 20 phases complete 🎯

**This run (16, 17, 18, 19, 20):**
- `[x]` 16 Checkpoints + diff viewer — consumes Lovable-shipped `checkpoints` + `checkpoint_files` tables + `checkpoint-restore`/`checkpoint-diff` edge fns; `checkpointStore` with lazy file + diff loading, FIFO compare-selection; `CheckpointTimeline` with milestone amber dual-halo dots and ghost incremental; `CheckpointCard` (collapsed/expanded); inline `DiffViewer` with red/green gutters; `RestoreConfirmModal` via destructive Pill; `CompareBar` with unified/split toggle in Modal; `/checkpoints` route live.
- `[x]` 17 Settings depth — consumes Lovable-shipped `agent_configs` + `mcp_servers` + `agent_secrets` + `agent-config-save` edge fn; `agentSettingsStore` with draft/dirty/save/discard; `/settings/agents` index + `/settings/agents/:id` editor; 8 sub-components (EnvSwitcher, PromptEditor, ToolGrid, McpList, SubAgentList, VoiceCardGrid, Keychain masked, StickySaveFooter with amber dirty color + beforeunload guard).
- `[x]` 18 Command palette ⌘K — substituted legacy 296-line `CommandPalette.tsx` with new `components/palette/*`. `paletteStore` (localStorage-backed recent), `paletteSearch` (token-overlap + recency scoring, match-range computation for `<mark>` wraps), `CommandPalette` (portal, ⌘K toggle, ⌘1-5 scope hotkeys, body scroll lock), `PaletteResults` (grouped + agent-tinted left-accent bar). Old file deleted.
- `[x]` 19 Attachments + computer-use — 11 files total. `attachmentStore` + `browserSessionStore`; `AttachmentChip` / `AttachmentDropOverlay` / `MessageAttachment` / `ImagePreview` (per-agent gradient variants) / `CodePreviewCard` (reuses Phase 15 syntax highlighter + 220px fade mask + Expand toggle); `BrowserCard` shell with live-pulsing status dot + URL bar + 40px grid viewport; `BrowserCursor` (300ms smooth-tracking, vektor-colored 1.5s cursor-ring keyframe); `BrowserActionLog` with status-tinted rows.
- `[x]` 20 Mobile shell — `/_mobile` dev-only preview route mounting two `<PhoneFrame>`s (390×772 with notch, 40px radius, 8px bezel) side-by-side; full stack of `MobileStatusBar` (live time + signal/wifi/battery glyphs), `MobileHeader` (hamburger → drawer), `MobileMessages` with per-agent role color, `MobileSubAgentStrip` (4px murmur dots with m-murmur 1.6s pulse), pill `MobileComposer`, 4-tab `MobileBottomNav`, `MobileDrawer` (300px left slide + backdrop), `MobileGroupStage` (84×84 circles with per-agent m-halo 2s speaking ring). Preview hidden in production builds via `import.meta.env.MODE !== 'development'` gate.

### FINAL STATUS — all 20 phases complete

**Phases completed (20/20):** 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

**Phases blocked:** None — both previously-blocked phases (16, 17) unblocked and shipped after Lovable delivered the backend in commits `65c3655`–`9059865`.

**Backend asks queue:** All closed. Memory candidates + checkpoints + agent configs all live.

**Open questions:** None.

**Commits pushed across all three runs:** 22 feature commits + 3 plan updates.
- Run 1 (01–04): `67d491a`, `5805f4c`, `a68193f`, `e19ba27`
- Run 2 (05–15): `ba0a2fd`, `2275434`, `292f3eb`, `43f285a`, `0dfc4aa`, `525c69c`, `3b8d08f`, `aa4af4b`, `1f5c24d`, `c37d8ee`, `6cbbf45`
- Run 3 (16–20): `f744247`, `433d938`, `daf1d14`, `61d7ade`, `e695b25`
- Plan summaries: `2f590da`, `02e2119`, + this one.

**Deferred consumer wirings (opportunistic):** phases 03, 06, 11, 14, 15, 19 all shipped primitives without refactoring ChatView/MessageList/MessageBubble. These are *ready-for-consumption* components; sweep in when ChatView is touched for unrelated reasons. Total ~8 spots where a future `<Composer />` / `<MessageRow />` / `<RichBody />` / `<PermissionInline />` / `<AgentErroredCard />` / `<MessageAttachment />` / `<AttachmentDropOverlay />` swap would land.

**Verification signal:** Every commit verified via `browser_evaluate` computed-style audit against spec values. Dev server on :8082 renders cleanly with 0 console errors throughout. `/_mobile` preview route renders both mobile phone frames at spec dimensions (390×772, 40px radius, 22px composer).

### Earlier summaries (preserved)

#### 2026-04-24 autonomous run (resumed, part 2) — 15 phases complete total

**Phases completed this run (11 new, 15 total across both runs):**

_Run 1 (phases 01–04):_ Foundation tokens, Primitives library, Composer shimmer alignment, Drawer system.

_Run 2 (phases 05–15):_
- `[x]` 05 Notifications drawer — Rail bell + `NotificationsDrawer` consuming `thought_initiations` + `entity_activity_log`; filter chips, sectioned cards, Approve/Deny actions, realtime subscribe, markAllRead
- `[x]` 06 Thread detail drawer — METADATA/PARTICIPANTS/ACTIVITY; inline rename; pin toggle; JSON export; ⌘I shortcut (LINKED MEMORY + RELATED THREADS + Archive omitted per schema gaps)
- `[x]` 07 ActivityTimeline component — reusable vertical timeline with typed rows + checkpoint dual halos + date dividers + `activityLogToTimeline()` mapper
- `[x]` 08 Memory Browse/Digest — consumes Lovable-shipped backend; `memoryCandidatesStore`, `MnemosModeToggle`, `DigestView`, `CandidateCard`; pin/commit/edit/reject via edge fn
- `[x]` 09 Sub-agent visualization — `subAgentStore`, `SubAgentIndicator` (3×3 murmur dots, deterministic per-id timing), `SubAgentRow` (120ms spawn stagger), `SubAgentOverlay` (340px right panel with gantt + event log), `UndoToast`, DEV mock hook
- `[x]` 10 Group session voice room — `/group` route, `groupSessionStore`, three-agent stage (Luca/Vektor/Anima 160px cards with halos + waveforms), queue indicator, transcript with partial-text blinking cursor, listening bar
- `[x]` 11 Multi-agent comms primitives — `MessageRow`, `MentionPill`, `MentionAutocomplete`, `HandoffCard`, `TargetIndicator`, `StreamingCursor`, `ThinkingDots`, `SystemEvent` (under `mc-` CSS prefix to avoid existing class collisions)
- `[x]` 12 Observability widget — collapsed 28px Rail dock + 320px expanded panel; 5s polling; per-agent status dots with running halo; 24-bin sparkline; active-sub-agents list
- `[x]` 13 Onboarding — `/onboarding` page with staggered name reveal (0.2/0.6/1.0s delays) + chain-fade greeting at 1.4/1.8s + checklist at 2.0s + actions at 2.4s; `FirstRunGate` auto-redirects new users; `?onboarding=1` QA forcer
- `[x]` 14 Permissions + states — `PermissionInline` + `PermissionModal` (portal, focus-trap, destructive confirm) + `ConnectionBanner` (realtime channel subscription + Retry) + `AgentOfflinePrompt` + `AgentErroredCard`
- `[x]` 15 Rich content rendering — `RichBody` wrapping react-markdown + remark-gfm, minimal regex `syntaxHighlight` (js/ts/tsx/json/sh/css/html/sql), `.rich-body` block with all markdown elements using phase-01 tokens, agent-colored syntax spans, `.chat-image` placeholder, kbd cap

**Phases blocked (2):**
- `[B]` 16 Checkpoints + diff viewer — needs `checkpoints` + `checkpoint_files` tables + `checkpoint-restore` + `checkpoint-diff` edge fns via Lovable
- `[B]` 17 Settings depth — needs `agent_configs` + `mcp_servers` + `agent_secrets` tables + `agent-config-save` edge fn via Lovable

**Phases not started (3):** 18 Command palette, 19 Attachments + computer-use, 20 Mobile shell.

**Open questions:** None. Multiple "deferred consumer wiring" notes in decision log (phase 03 composer extraction, phase 06 archive action, phase 11 autocomplete wiring, phase 14 MessageList branch, phase 15 MessageBubble wiring) — all are intentional primitives-only shipments; the components are ready for consumption when ChatView is touched for unrelated reasons.

**Commits pushed this run:** 11 feature commits + 2 plan updates. Full list: `ba0a2fd` (05), `2275434` (07), `292f3eb` (06), `43f285a` (08), `0dfc4aa` (09), `525c69c` (10), `3b8d08f` (11), `aa4af4b` (12), `1f5c24d` (13), `c37d8ee` (14), `6cbbf45` (15), + plan updates along the way.

**Suggested next-session focus:**
1. **Phase 18 Command palette** — existing `src/components/CommandPalette.tsx` (296 lines) handles ⌘K but needs the scope-tabs / ⌘1-5 nav / colored-left-accent-bar / `<mark>` highlighting / recent chips / quick actions redesign per phase-18 spec. Substitution scope ~600 lines; consider 18a (palette subdirectory primitives + store) / 18b (substitute in App.tsx).
2. **Phase 19 Attachments + computer-use** — purely frontend, no backend dep. Can proceed anytime.
3. **Phase 20 Mobile shell** — purely frontend. Can proceed anytime.
4. **Phases 16 + 17** — kick Lovable backend asks (both specs include copyable prompts). Frontend primitives ready to ship as follow-ons once tables land.
5. **Deferred consumer wirings** — if Riley touches ChatView for other reasons, sweep through to wire Composer.tsx / MessageList branching on permission_request + agent_error / MessageBubble → RichBody / composer @-mention autocomplete.

**Verification signal:** dev server on :8082 loads `/auth/login` with 0 console errors after every commit. Computed-style audits confirmed spec compliance on 50+ CSS tokens across all 11 phases.
